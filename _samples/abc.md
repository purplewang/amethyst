title: What to Pack: The Travel Essentials
client: Goorin Bros.
---

You’ve chosen your travel destination, booked the flights, and even have the itinerary of recommended sights and must-try eateries down to the last Yelp review. The final step to making your trip perfect is deciding what to pack, and that, hatters, are the travel essentials. We’re not simply talking traveling light (hauling seam-ripping luggage is -not- how to travel in style), but making your trip enjoyable and memorable, too (in addition to you lookin’ sharp, of course).

We know it can be difficult deciding on what to pack (we’ll get to -how- to pack later). That’s why we went over the fundamentals on what to pack with well-traveled
bloggers Blair Badge (LoveBlair), Trevor Traynor, and Tonya Smith (The Moptop). We even turned the tables on ourselves at Goorin Bros. for the best packing lists ever. From the
perfect hat to leisurely literature, here are the travel essentials and packing tips that’ll make your trip one to remember.

What’s in Goorin’s Travel Bag
Our travel essentials are gentlemanly, compact,
leisurely, and not to mention color-coordinated. A
lightweight summer jacket, button-down shirt, linen
pants, patterned socks, leather passport case, The
Stranger by Albert Camus, Goorin Bros. Cuba fedora
from the Cuba Libre straw hat collection, cigars,
Goorin Bros. matches, compact Lomo camera,
foldable sunglasses, classic pair of oxfords, belt, and
journal for penning down memories and musings.

Our Packing Advice
A seemingly no-brainer, but bring a hat. Whether
you’re jetting to the sunny tropics or heading to the
colder climates, a hat makes the biggest diference in
terms of comfort and style. For summer getaways, we
recommend perusing our Goorin Bros. Cuba Libre
straw hat collection that features packable, breathable
hats that ofer the best protection your head could ever
get.

The Non-Non-Essentials
Notebooks and literature may seem excessive when
it comes to packing, but we believe a truly good trip
involves a mix of exploration and refection. We like to
leave at least a day or two free from the constraints of
travel plans to spend time soaking in the surroundings
and culture of our travel destination. Leave your
itinerary at the hotel and take your camera, favorite
novel, or notebook out for some leisurely, anti-tourist
activity
